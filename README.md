# BasicProjects
Trying to complete over 50 projects(in progess) in various categories in Java.

List of projects -

1. User input & Replace String template "Hello <>, How are you?" - I/P -> Take username as input.Ensure username has min 3characters O/P -> Replace <> with proper name and print the string.
2. Multiplication table - Take a number as an input and print its multiplication table upto 10
3. Shape Area & Perimeter calculator - Create an abstract class called Shape. Create another class which will inherit Shape class and store all the shapes like triangle, rectangle, circle and square. Let a class Main take type of shape, lenghts as input and print area & perimeter as output. Throw an exception if shape not found
4. Flip Coin and print percentage of Heads and Tails - I/P -> The number of times to flip coin. Ensure it is positive integer. Logic -> Use random function to get value between 0 to 1. If <0.5 then tails or heads. O/P -> Percentage of heads & tails.
5. Leap Year - Take a year as an input, ensure it is a 4 digit number. Determine if it is a leap year and print it.
6. Harmonic Number - Take a number N as input, ensure N != 0, compute 1+1/2+1/3+...+1/N & print the Nth Harmonic value.
7. Gambler - Stimulate a gambler who starts with $stake & place fair $1 bets until he/she goes broke(i.e has no money) or reach $goal.Keeps track of the number of times he/she wins & the number of bets he/she makes. Run the experiment N times, average the results, and print them out. 
8. Power of 2 - This program takes a command line argumemt N and prints the table of the powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^N. Take power value N as an input and print the power table as an input. Note- program will only work if 0<= N < 31, as 2^31 will overflow int
